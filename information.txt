In this zip-file, we have the report for our Machine Learning Project: Powerpredict.

This zip-File contains:
- report (PDF)
- Powerpredict-Notebook
- 2 executable jobLib-Files for our models (as a backup if the ones, produced, would somehow not work)
- k_nearest_enighbors_implementation


We added one additional implementation, because it is the one that outperforms the other two implementations,
but the library that is used in this implementation is not available on "ifi-europa.uibk.ac.at". We are not sure,
if the implementation is correct due to the encoder, but we decided to just give it a shot and submit this one too,
because the performance was quite good (train: 954.26, test: 1881.62, hidden-test: 2503.17), -> but also Overfitting.
Additional Information: You need the CSV-Files to test the implementation!
